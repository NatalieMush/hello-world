Coding at first is easy, however once you practice a lot you will get bored of it. 
Have you ever thought that you were going to have to be a programmer?
I have been a programmer in a dead end job for the past 30 years.
When I wake up in the morning, I regret most of my life descions.
I hack Facebook every day only to realize that most people on there have much more exiting lives than I do.
I then delete their accounts.
